    <h4>
      ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS
    </h4>
    <p>
      My first experience with acute care hospital claims and litigation management was in 1990, when I was 
      Senior Litigation Supervisor for Dynamark, a TPA that was a subsidiary of the Johnson & Higgins brokerage 
      firm.&nbsp; My clients were self-insured hospitals, including Columbia Healthcare Corporation’s first 
      hospitals in El Paso, Texas.&nbsp; I performed all of the traditional claims and litigation management 
      functions for these facilities.&nbsp; In 1993, I served as Columbia’s Corporate Claims Manager, while 
      an employee of Healthcare Insurance Services, a division of The Galtney Group in Houston.&nbsp; This 
      involved developing a claim program and philosophy for Columbia’s 25 hospitals, most of which were 
      located in Florida and Texas.&nbsp; In 1994, I moved to Nashville, to bring “in-house”, the claim 
      program of OrNda Healthcorp.&nbsp; This involved 50 hospitals in about 15 states, with a heavy 
      concentration of these facilities being located in Florida, Texas and California.&nbsp; We were 
      self-insured for $3,000,000 per occurrence, and I personally managed Florida and Texas, and had Claim 
      Managers who managed the other states.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of my experience with acute care hospitals, I have managed hundreds of claims, settled many 
      claims on my own, or through authority granted to defense counsel, or via mediation.&nbsp; I have dealt 
      with nuisance value slip and falls and multi-million dollar &quot;bad baby&quot; cases in Miami and Houston, as 
      well as serious exposures in other dangerous venues.&nbsp; I actually worked in a hospital for one week 
      each year at OrNda with the Risk Manager, so I could learn more about hospital operations and risk management 
      from a more local perspective.
    </p>

    <h4>
      PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS
    </h4>
    <p>
      In 1998, I was Vice President of Risk Management at Behavioral Healthcare Corporation, a company of 43 
      psychiatric hospitals in about 15-16 states.&nbsp; As the only person in the risk management department, 
      I managed all the claims and litigation, thus I am intimately familiar with the issues relative to 
      evaluating these exposures.
    </p>

    <h4>
      PHYSICIANS
    </h4>
    <p>
      From 1988-1990, I was a Claims Attorney for Insurance Corporation of America, a physician carrier based 
      in Houston.&nbsp; I literally handled 375 claims/lawsuits at a time, primarily in Texas.&nbsp; In 1997, I served 
      as Vice President of Claims at MedPartners in Birmingham.&nbsp; At the time, this company was the largest 
      physician practice management company in the country, with physician practices in over 40 states.&nbsp; I 
      managed much of this litigation, and supervised Claim Managers in Fort Lauderdale, Chicago and Long Beach, 
      California.
    </p>
    <h4>
      LONG TERM CARE
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the early 1990’s, I served as a Claims Manager for a surplus lines carrier in Houston that insured many 
      Texas nursing homes.&nbsp; In the late 1990’s, I served as Director of Claims for Mariner Post-Acute Network, 
      a provider of over 430 facilities in over 35 states, including 100 facilities in Texas, 60-70 in Florida and 
      30-40 in California, representing three of the most volatile jurisdictions in the country for long term care 
      litigation.
      &nbsp; I have mediated long term care cases pursuant to a number of bankruptcies in various states.&nbsp; All the 
      states I have mediated long term care cases in are listed in the <a href="/mediated.htm">Places Mediated</a> 
      link on the web site.
      <!-- &nbsp; I have mediated long term care cases pursuant to 4 Texas bankruptcies, Texas Health Enterprises, 
      Harvest Communities, Heart of Texas and Autumn Hills, as well as Integrated Health Services and Centennial 
      Health Care.
      &nbsp; I have also mediated these cases in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, 
      Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, 
      Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, 
      Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington State, 
      West Virginia and Wisconsin.&nbsp; To my knowledge, I am the only mediator in the country who has worked for 
      both an insurance carrier and long term care provider mediating these complex cases. -->

    <h4>
      SUMMARY
    </h4>
    <p>
      Over the years, I have been fortunate enough to evaluate probably a couple of thousand claims from many different 
      perspectives, for insurance companies, a TPA and 4 health care providers.&nbsp; This gives me a unique insight as to 
      any case, especially when there are multiple defendants, for in these cases, the biggest dispute often isn’t the 
      value of the case, it’s apportioning exposure among the co-defendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would invite you to take advantage of this background in health care to amicably resolve your cases prior to trial.
