    <p>
      From 1988-1993, I managed claims and litigation in Houston on behalf of 2 insurance companies that insured physicians, 
      nursing homes, psychologists, blood banks, funeral homes, and other miscellaneous health care providers.&nbsp; 
      I also managed claims and litigation on behalf of a Third Party Administrator, where my clients were self-insured hospitals.&nbsp; 
      I also worked for a major insurance broker, developing a claim department for a national self-insured acute care provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1994-1999, I built self-insured claim departments, ranging from $100,000-$3,000,000 per occurrence for 4 national 
      health care companies, providing services in acute care hospitals, physician practice management, nursing homes and 
      psychiatric hospitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience afforded me the opportunity to travel throughout the country, negotiating settlements, with full knowledge 
      that only 2%–3% of all cases eventually go to trial.&nbsp; From 1988-1999, I was involved in literally thousands of cases 
      involving virtually every type of health care provider there is.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the things that intrigued me about settling cases was the development of mediation as a tool to be utilized to 
      successfully resolve cases.&nbsp; Having negotiated settlements on behalf of 2 insurance companies, a third party administrator, 
      an insurance broker, and 4 national self-insured corporations, I have developed a mediation service that allows all 
      litigants to take advantage of my unique background as an attorney who spent 11 years on the “front burner” negotiating 
      settlements of nursing home, medical malpractice and general liability, personal injury and wrongful death cases to assist 
      them in the amicable resolution of their claims and lawsuits prior to trial.
