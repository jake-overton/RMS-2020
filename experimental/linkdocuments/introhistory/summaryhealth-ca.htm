    <h4>
      ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS
    </h4>
    <p>
      My first experience with California acute care hospital claims and litigation management was in 1994, when I moved 
      to Nashville, to bring “in-house”, the claim program of OrNda Healthcorp. This involved 50 hospitals in about 15 
      states, with a heavy concentration of these facilities being located in California (approximately 15 facilities in 
      Los Angeles and Orange Counties).&nbsp; The California piece involved the merger of 3 Companies owning hospitals in 
      Southern California, and interviewing many law firms to identify the firms best suited to a proactive claim and 
      litigation management program.
    <p>
      We were self-insured for $3,000,000 per occurrence, and I personally managed Texas, Florida and California, before 
      hiring a Claim Manager in Long Beach, California, who I trained by spending one week a month with for one year.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of my experience with acute care hospitals, I have managed hundreds of claims, settled many claims on my
      own, or through authority granted to defense counsel, or via mediation. I have dealt with nuisance value slip and 
      falls and multi-million dollar “bad baby” cases in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, and everything else in-between.
    </p>

    <h4>
      PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS
    </h4>
    <p>
      In 1998, I was Vice President of Risk Management at Behavioral Healthcare Corporation, a company of 43 psychiatric 
      hospitals in about 15-16 states.&nbsp; Many of these facilities were located in both the Bay Area and Southern 
      California, and as the only person in the risk management department, I managed all the claims and litigation, thus 
      I am intimately familiar with the issues relative to evaluating these exposures.
    </p>

    <h4>
      PHYSICIANS
    </h4>
    <p>
      In 1997, I served as Vice President of Claims at MedPartners in Birmingham. At the time, this company was the 
      largest physician practice management company in the country, with physician practices in over 40 states, including 
      a large presence in Southern California through the state’s largest physician practice, Mullikin Medical Group out 
      of Long Beach, where MedPartners’ Western Division was headquartered.&nbsp; I managed much of this litigation, and 
      supervised our 2 Claim Managers in Long Beach.
    </p>
    <h4>
      LONG TERM CARE
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the late 1990’s, I served as Director of Claims for Mariner Post-Acute Network, a provider of over 430 facilities
      in over 35 states, including 30-40 facilities in California.
    <p>
      I have mediated nursing home cases throughout California, including Los Angeles, Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino, 
      San Diego and San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my knowledge, I am the only mediator in the country who has worked for both an insurance carrier and nursing home
      provider mediating these complex cases.
    </p>
    <h4>
      SUMMARY
    </h4>
    <p>
      Over the years, I have been fortunate enough to evaluate probably a couple of thousand claims from many different perspectives, for insurance companies, a TPA and 4 health care providers.&nbsp; This gives me a unique insight as to any case, especially when there are multiple defendants, for in these cases, the biggest dispute often isn’t the value of the case, it’s apportioning exposure among the co-defendants.
    <p>
      I would submit to you there are no attorney/mediators anywhere such as myself that can offer you this level of 
      expertise in healthcare.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns, or need any additional information regarding my background in these areas, I 
      would invite you to contact me.
