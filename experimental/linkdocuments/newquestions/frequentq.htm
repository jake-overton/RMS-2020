			<p><b>ISSUE</b></p>
			<p>
				How much will it cost to utilize you as mediator?&nbsp; Who is going to pay for your time and expenses relative 
				to travel? Why would we use you out of Atlanta, if we have plenty of local mediators where our cases are?
			</p>
			<p><b>FACT</b></p>
			<p>
				The <a href="../newfees/feesstruct.htm">Fee Structure</a> section addresses fees, depending on the state where 
				the case is to be mediated.&nbsp; Regardless of jurisdiction, the Fee Structure offers a very competitive rate 
				that represents less than the cost of 1 deposition.&nbsp; Please note, I am responsible for my travel time and 
				expenses, so this will not serve as a deterrent to anyone wishing to utilize my services.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason my service can be of much greater value than other mediators is that from 1988-1999, I was involved in 
				probably 2000 medical malpractice cases involving nursing homes, hospitals, physicians, labs, clinics, and other 
				miscellaneous healthcare providers.&nbsp; As a former claims person, from 1988-1999, all I  did was strategize how 
				cases could be settled.&nbsp; That's exactly what mediation is all about, developing strategy for putting parties 
				in a position to settle their disputes for sums that all parties can live with.&nbsp; In addition, having managed 
				national claim programs, it is easier to familiarize oneself with state  statutes relative to a particular case, 
				than it is to learn an industry, such as long term care, hospital negligence, physician malpractice, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have mediated thus far in any of the cities and states listed in the <a href="../../mediated.htm">Places 
				Mediated</a> link, and I anticipate it won't be regarding future cases scheduled in any other state where my services are requested.
			</p>
			<p><b>SOLUTION</b></p>
			<p>
				Since I am picking up the travel time and expense myself, it is just a matter of allowing me with my experience in all aspects of long term care, medical malpractice and personal injury litigation as well as mediation to work with the respective parties toward resolving their dispute.

			</div>
			<p><b>ISSUE</b></p>
			<p>
				If you're picking up the travel time and expense yourself, how far will you travel to mediate our cases?
			</p>
			<p><b>FACT</b></p>
			<p>
				The Fee Structure includes travel to anywhere in the country.&nbsp; All cases outside Atlanta are mediated on a 
				flat fee basis, with no charge for travel time and expense.&nbsp; Discounts are given to all parties for multiple 
				Defendant cases.&nbsp; Please refer to the <a href="../newfees/feesstruct.htm">Fee Structure</a> page for a listing of fees by region.
			</p>
			<p><b>SOLUTION</b></p>
			<p>
				If you have a case, wherever it might be, where you believe my experience would be of benefit to all parties in 
				attempting to resolve the dispute, please let me know. Don't assume that geography is an issue to me, because it 
				is not.

			<p><b>ISSUE</b></p>
			<p>
				Since you don't have offices in every city, where do you mediate your cases outside of Atlanta?
			</p>
			<p><b>FACT</b></p>
			<p>
				Flying from Atlanta to mediate a case in the offices of either plaintiff attorneys or defense attorneys has not
				been an impediment to parties wishing to utilize my services.&nbsp; I have successfully mediated cases in both 
				plaintiff and defense attorney offices, and when compared to the cases I have mediated in Atlanta, I have seen no 
				difference in how the mediation transpired, nor can I say an outcome would have been any different by virtue of 
				where the mediation was held.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other mediators I have talked to who have mediated in the offices of plaintiff and/or defense attorneys also have 
				seen no difference in their outcomes.</p>
			<p><b>SOLUTION</b></p>
			<p>
				Offer to mediate the dispute in plaintiff counsel's office.&nbsp; If the parties cannot agree on mediating the 
				case at plaintiff counsel's office, offer to mediate the dispute at defense counsel's office.&nbsp; If the 
				parties cannot agree on mediating the case at defense counsel's office, court reporting firms' office space or 
				hotel conference rooms can be utilized to mediate the dispute.
