			<p> I have had the pleasure of working with Richard M. Strauss, Esquire, as a
				Mediator.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss is an attorney well versed in long-term care,
				medical malpractice, personal injury litigation and mediation, and I found
				him to be extremely effective and diligent as a mediator.&nbsp; I found Mr.
				Strauss to be very knowledgeable and able to objectively analyze the issues
				of the case, and able to identify the risks to both parties, which
				effectively led to a resolution of the dispute we mediated together.&nbsp; I
				would be pleased to be able to mediate other cases with Mr. Strauss in the
				future.</p>
			<p>One of the reasons Mr. Strauss is such a strong mediator is his background
				in the field.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss has experience in handling claims for a
				large national nursing home chain.&nbsp; This background makes him uniquely
				qualified to understand the key issues in a long-term care case.&nbsp;
				However, his expertise is not limited to long-term care.</p>
			<p>I was greatly impressed by Mr. Strauss' level of preparation and
				understanding of the issues in the case which we mediated together.&nbsp; He
				was well versed in all aspects of the litigation and knew, in great detail,
				the facts of the case.&nbsp; His opening comments were specifically directed
				toward creating a conciliatory environment necessary for the compromise and
				resolution of the claim.&nbsp; His approach was to have a thorough
				discussion and analysis of the issues in the case with each side, pointing
				out the strengths and weaknesses of each party's case.&nbsp; Throughout the
				process, he was willing to offer options and suggestions to facilitate the
				mediation and negotiations.</p>
			<p>I believe that Mr. Strauss would be able to effectively mediate a case,
				whether it be a nursing home case, medical malpractice case, or other
				personal injury case, regardless of the jurisdiction or venue, and
				regardless of the differences in style or opinions of opposing
				counsel.&nbsp; He is quite effective at bringing the two sides together to
				achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution.</p>
			<p>I hope to be able to mediate additional cases with Mr. Strauss in the near
				future.&nbsp; I would highly recommend Mr. Strauss as a mediator and would
				be happy to discuss my experience with Mr. Strauss should you need further
				information.</p>
