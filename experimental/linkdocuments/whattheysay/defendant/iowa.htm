      <p>As a defense attorney practicing in Iowa and Illinois in the areas of medical
        malpractice, long term care and personal injury litigation, I have used Richard
        M. Strauss as a mediator multiple times.&nbsp; In every case, Mr. Strauss has
        excelled in objectively analyzing the issues, identifying the risks to both
        parties, and has been able to lead the parties to a resolution of the case.</p>
      <p>I believe Mr. Strauss is so effective at mediating cases because of his
        background in the medical malpractice, long term care, personal injury and wrongful
        death areas, his level of preparation and understanding of the key issues in the
        case, facilitating opening comments that are specifically directed towards creating
        the conciliatory environment necessary for compromise and resolution, his deliberate
        approach towards a thorough discussion and analysis of the issues in the case, his
        willingness to offer options and suggestions throughout the entire settlement
        negotiation phase of the mediation, and his ability to effectively mediate cases
        regardless of jurisdiction or venue.</p>
      <p>I fully intend to continue using Mr. Strauss as a mediator in my cases and have
        no reservations recommending him to others, especially with cases in the medical
        malpractice, long term care, personal injury and wrongful death field.</p>
