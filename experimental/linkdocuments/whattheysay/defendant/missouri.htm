      <p>I write this letter as a strong recommendation for the services of Mr. Strauss
        as a mediator.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss was friendly, respectful and professional throughout
        our mediation process...&nbsp; He was able to conscientiously lay ground work for an
        open dialogue from the onset of the mediation.&nbsp; Perhaps the one thing that sets
        Mr. Strauss apart from others in his level of preparation.&nbsp; His preparation is
        unrivaled.</p>
      <p>I highly recommend his services and plan to use him again on the next opportunity.</p>

      <p>I am writing this letter of recommendation for Richard Strauss.&nbsp; Richard
        mediated a nursing home case for me in March, 2008.&nbsp; He did an excellent
        job, and we were able to settle an extremely difficult case with several complex
        issues.</p>
      <p>Richard's background in the field of nursing home litigation (as well as other
        medical and personal injury cases) is exceptional.&nbsp; That background came
        through very clearly throughout the mediation.</p>
      <p>His level of preparation was the most thorough that I have ever seen in any
        mediator in 20 years of mediations.&nbsp; This preparation gave him an excellent
        understanding of the key issues in the case, and we did not have to spend any
        time getting everyone "up to speed."</p>
      <p>Richard did an excellent job of dealing with the attorneys, but also in using
        the opening session to deal directly with the plaintiffs (who were understandably
        unfamiliar with the mediation process) to create an environment for compromise and
        resolution. </p>
      <p>He utilized his background, preparation and approach to the individuals to create
        an environment where the issues in the case could be thoroughly discussed and
        analyzed.&nbsp; He was willing to offer opinions and suggestions throughout the
        mediation process and, in the ultimate measure of success, was able to get the
        case settled. </p>
      <p>Richard's willingness to travel, included in his flat fee,&nbsp;regardless of
        jurisdiction and venue, makes him uniquely suited to mediate, especially among
        parties who may be difficult or who may have reservations regarding a party's
        relationship to local mediators.&nbsp; If anyone has any questions, I would be
        happy to address them directly.</p>

      <p>I have mediated several cases with Richard Strauss, and would like to take
        a few moments to provide this highest recommendation.</p>
      <p>First, I would like to express my background in long-term care.&nbsp; I
        have been representing nursing homes for over 15 years, and have tried several
        cases to verdict.&nbsp; I have directly handled, evaluated or managed nearly
        500 nursing home cases in over 15 states.</p>
      <p>Richard Strauss is the most knowledgeable, hardworking and effective long-term
        care mediator I have ever experienced.&nbsp; He shows up prepared on every case
        issue, ready to discuss with both sides the strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; He
        treats people with respect, and I find everyone involved in his mediations to
        consider him an excellent communicator.&nbsp; Richard comes highly recommended
        by members of the plaintiff and defense bar.</p>
      <p>If anyone wishes to discuss his abilities, I am happy to speak with them.</p>
