			<p>I am writing this letter on behalf of Richard who I have had the pleasure
				of mediating two wrongful death nursing home claims in the past (6)
				months... Richard had an excellent grasp of the issues affecting both of
				these claims and was able to facilitate both parties' recognition of the
				strengths and weaknesses of their case as well as the potential outcome of
				litigated issues... I would not hesitate to use Mr. Strauss to mediate
				claims involving personal injury or death, particularly if those cases were
				large and complex.</p>

			<p>...Mr. Strauss has extensive experience especially in the area of nursing

				Defendant's points of view.&nbsp; This knowledge, understanding and
				experience proved to be of great importance in settling the case... I have

			<p>I am writing both to congratulate you and thank you for our recent
				successful mediation.&nbsp; The reasons that I decided to take a chance on
				you were... I was totally confident that the case could not be settled at
				mediation under any circumstances, so it really did not make any difference
				who the mediator was.&nbsp; In this regard, I had the input of the
				Plaintiffs' attorney, who reported that he "extremely pessimistic" that the
				case could be settled at its present stages...</p>
			<p>The defect in all of the above logical reasoning was that none of us had
				ever met you.&nbsp; Your background in the health care liability arena is
				impressive enough, but your resume pales in comparison to "that thing you
				do" when you are engaged in the actual mediation process.&nbsp; I believe
				that you possess a unique combination of professional training, experience
				and "people" skills that entitle you to adopt the personal motto "I never
				met a case I couldn't get settled".</p>
			<p>Please feel free to share this letter if you are interested in spreading
				the word that
				1) you have extraordinary competence in the health care liability field,
				...3) you have proved that you manage to get matters resolved, even against
				all odds.</p>

			<p>I recently had the opportunity to mediate a nursing home death case in
				Texas with Richard Strauss as mediator.&nbsp; The case was filed by one of
				the best Texas nursing home plaintiffs' attorneys in one of the worst Texas
				venues and carried significant exposure for our client.&nbsp; Although I had
				significant doubt that the case would settle, due in large part to the
				efforts of the mediator, we were able to resolve the case on a very
				reasonable basis, in relation to other Texas nursing home settlements.</p>
			<p>I found Richard Strauss to be knowledgeable both in the medical aspects of
				the case and the unique exposure factors with which nursing home defense
				attorneys are faced in Texas at this time.&nbsp; He remained objective and was
				able to pacify the unsophisticated plaintiffs through a couple of stages in
				the mediation where I was certain we had met an impasse.</p>

			<p>I recently had the opportunity to participate on behalf of a nursing home
				defendant, in a case mediated by Richard M. Strauss.&nbsp; I was very
				impressed with Mr. Strauss' skills as a mediator.&nbsp; I found him to be
				completely objective and impartial.&nbsp; There were significant insurance
				issues involved in my case, and Richard's ability to quickly analyze and
				effectively communicate those issues to the other side was crucial to the
				success of the mediation.</p>

			<p>...At the recommendation of my insurance carrier client, AIG, I used
				Richard as a mediator in the...case, and based upon his excellent
				performance in that case, I also used him recently, in a much more difficult
				case... It was rather unusual to use an out of town mediator in either of
				these cases as Houston has some very excellent mediators locally... However,
				I found Richard to be extremely competent and effective at his job... Both
				of the referenced cases were death cases and were possessed of very
				significant emotional attachments, not only by the bereaved Plaintiffs, but
				by the Defendant owners of the nursing facilities involved... Richard was
				able to work through these very potentially volatile emotional issues with
				both sides and bring the cases to what I have to consider to be a very
				successful conclusion.</p>

			<p>I recently have had the opportunity to have Mr. Strauss serve as a mediator
				in a complex piece of nursing home litigation involving not only the
				problems with nursing home litigation in general but complicated by issues
				of bankruptcy.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss was extremely effective as a mediator and
				helped us bring the case to a resolution... Mr. Strauss was able to reduce
				the complexity of this litigation to understandable terms for the
				Plaintiffs... Considering the bankruptcy issues involved, it was extremely
				beneficial for Mr. Strauss to be able to discuss such complex issues in day
				to day terms.&nbsp; He was also extremely persuasive with my clients
				including both insurance representatives as well as facility
				representatives... I would highly recommend Mr. Strauss as a mediator in
				complex litigation matters.&nbsp; He is particularly adept at the nursing
				home and medical malpractice issues as was found in our mediation.</p>

			<p>I recently had the opportunity to again mediate with Richard M.
				Strauss.&nbsp; This case was an HMO liability case which had many
				complicated legal nuances due to the unsettled nature of HMO liability in
				this state... Also, the case presented fairly large damage exposure,
				requiring a mediator with substantial experience to handle the case...
				Though the case did not settle on the day of mediation, it settled soon
				thereafter, much to the credit of Richard continuing to stick with the case
				in assisting the parties and bringing the matter to final closure.</p>
