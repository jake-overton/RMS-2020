        "I recently had an opportunity to work with Richard Strauss in the resolution of a complex nursing home case.&nbsp; Richard's extensive background in the nursing home field certainly gave him an advantage in understanding and analyzing the medical, clinical and legal issues in our case.&nbsp; He had a thorough understanding of the facts and the parties' positions before the mediation started. Throughout the day, it was clear that he had the trust of both parties.&nbsp; He made helpful suggestions at appropriate points to move the parties to resolution.&nbsp; My client, the facility, was very satisfied with the outcome."
