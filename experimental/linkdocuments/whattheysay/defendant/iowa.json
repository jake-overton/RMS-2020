        "As a defense attorney practicing in Iowa and Illinois in the areas of medical malpractice, long term care and personal injury litigation, I have used Richard M. Strauss as a mediator multiple times.&nbsp; In every case, Mr. Strauss has excelled in objectively analyzing the issues, identifying the risks to both parties, and has been able to lead the parties to a resolution of the case.",
        "I believe Mr. Strauss is so effective at mediating cases because of his background in the medical malpractice, long term care, personal injury and wrongful death areas, his level of preparation and understanding of the key issues in the case, facilitating opening comments that are specifically directed towards creating the conciliatory environment necessary for compromise and resolution, his deliberate approach towards a thorough discussion and analysis of the issues in the case, his willingness to offer options and suggestions throughout the entire settlement negotiation phase of the mediation, and his ability to effectively mediate cases regardless of jurisdiction or venue.",
        "I fully intend to continue using Mr. Strauss as a mediator in my cases and have no reservations recommending him to others, especially with cases in the medical malpractice, long term care, personal injury and wrongful death field."
