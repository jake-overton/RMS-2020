			<p> I am engaged in the defense of medical liability claims, including the defense
				of nursing home negligence cases.&nbsp; I had the opportunity to utilize Mr.
				Strauss' services in conjunction with a nursing home case that my client wanted
				to settle, but not for a mint. I am happy to say that through Mr. Strauss'
				mediation expertise, skills and his sensitivity to and appreciation of the
				relevant factual, legal and emotional issues at play that my client's goals
				were realized. </p>
			<p> Mr. Strauss' subject matter expertise with respect to nursing homes and
				nursing issues was impressive; he was quickly conversant in the facts of my
				case and was very forthright and matter-of-fact with respect to its relative
				strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; It is my understanding that before becoming a
				mediator, Mr. Strauss was heavily involved in nursing home claims management.
				&nbsp; I would say that Mr. Strauss' experience in the nursing home industry
				definitely informs his work as a mediator facilitating the settlement of nursing
				home cases. </p>
			<p> I was also impressed with Mr. Strauss' ability to establish rapport with my
				opponent and his client.&nbsp; Nursing home cases are, quite often, highly
				emotionally charged.&nbsp; Although, in my estimation, my opponent's client
				was icy and unreceptive to begin with, I feel that Mr. Strauss made great
				in-roads with her to the extent that (1) he got her to open up and (2) to
				become realistic about the settlement value of her claim.&nbsp; As a consequence,
				the case was satisfactorily resolved.</p>
			<p> I would not hesitate to utilize Mr. Strauss' services again in any other
				case and I have no qualms about recommending him to other attorneys.</p>

			<p>My first awareness of Richard M. Strauss, Esquire as a mediator was a suggestion
				by one of Plaintiff's counsel in Oklahoma that primarily does nursing home work.
				&nbsp; I was initially suspicious of any such suggestion, especially with an
				individual who was not in the State of Oklahoma.&nbsp; However, Mr. Strauss
				transmitted to me his background information and with the consent of my
				client as well as the carrier, we engaged in mediation.&nbsp; Since that
				time I have utilized Mr. Strauss on two occasions for mediation, and have
				scheduled other cases with him as well.</p>
			<p>My experience with him has been such that I would highly recommend Mr. Strauss
				as a mediator in nursing home, medical malpractice and personal injury cases.</p>
			<p>Having his background in the nursing home industry as a former Director of
				Claims for a national nursing home provider, as well as working as a Claims
				Manager for an insurance carrier that was involved in writing and handling a
				high number of nursing home claims, he does come with a lot of experience in
				nursing home litigation.</p>
			<p>I have found that his evaluations are informed and in alignment with realistic
				figures.</p>
			<p>Further, I think another element Mr. Strauss adds to the mediation process is
				that if on the day of mediation there is not a complete meeting of the minds, he
				is willing to continue the process long distance with the participants, either
				individually or collectively, in an attempt to "keep the ball rolling"
				and resolve the case.&nbsp; This is included in his initial rate and is an
				additional benefit.&nbsp; His flat fee rate includes travel, and is cost
				competitive with the local rates for mediators.&nbsp; I also found that the
				flat fee rate was extremely reasonable, in that he reviews the materials
				submitted pre-mediation and always comes to the mediation with a fairly strong
				understanding of the case.&nbsp; This allows the parties to spend less time
				educating him and more time discussing settlement negotiations and strategies
				designed for case resolution.</p>
			<p>We all have different types of approaches to mediation and like the style of
				different mediators.&nbsp; I would recommend that if you have a nursing home,
				medical malpractice or personal injury action where you need a mediator with a
				unique experience in having negotiated hundreds of these cases to resolution
				throughout the country over the course of many years, that you utilize Richard
				Strauss.</p>
			<p>Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.</p>
