      <p> I'm writing today to recommend the mediation services of Richard M. Strauss,
        Esq.&nbsp; Recently, Mr. Strauss participated in the mediation of a nursing home
        malpractice case for our firm, and he did so with both skill and poise.</p>
      <p>Attorney Strauss arrived at the mediation clearly prepared and with a high
        degree of knowledge for the issues surrounding the case.&nbsp; He was recommended
        by the plaintiff's counsel as someone who has an extensive background in nursing
        home, medical malpractice, and personal injury litigation, and this was evident
        during the course of the session. </p>
      <p>Attorney Strauss began the mediation by leading off with some opening comments
        regarding the nature of the process.&nbsp; He gave the attorneys and our clients
        a clear understanding of what to expect, and his communication skills helped to
        create the conciliatory atmosphere necessary for the successful resolution of
        the case. </p>
      <p> We were able to reach a successful resolution of the case thanks in large part
        to Attorney Strauss' efforts and preparation.&nbsp; I would highly recommend Mr. Strauss
        as a mediator for any nursing home, medical malpractice, or personal injury matter
        that requires mediation.&nbsp; He is certainly qualified, prepared, and one of the
        most effective mediators I have ever come across in my 15 years I have been
        practicing in this area. </p>
      <p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.&nbsp; I would be
        happy to discuss Mr. Strauss' services in more detail.</p>

      <p>I am writing to recommend Richard Strauss as a mediator.&nbsp; In a recent case
        I mediated, Mr. Strauss was recommended by plaintiff's counsel to mediate a
        long term care case.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' background in the field of long term
        care gives him an unsurpassed body of knowledge that assists in mediating these
        cases.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss was unbelievably prepared for the mediation and knew the
        facts as well as the attorneys, which allowed him to understand the key issues in
        the case.</p>
      <p>Mr. Strauss also suggests that counsel not make opening statements
        in joint session and rather he makes opening comments that serve to bring the
        parties together rather than creating an initial divide, which can often occur
        with opening statements in mediations.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss also led us through
        a thorough discussion and analysis of the issues in the case in separate
        sessions and worked unbelievably hard following the conclusion of the mediation
        session to resolve this complex three party mediation.</p>
      <p>In addition, although Mr. Strauss is not from Massachusetts, he is effectively
        able to mediate long term care cases here due to his extensive knowledge in the
        field.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
