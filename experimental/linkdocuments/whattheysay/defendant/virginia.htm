			<p>I write to provide my strong recommendation for using Richard M. Strauss,
				Esq., as a mediator in any complex personal injury or medical malpractice
				case.</p>
			<p>I have used Richard on more than one occasion, and have found him to be
				incredibly prepared, professional and effective.&nbsp; Richard's unique
				background in medical malpractice, long-term care and personal injury
				litigation is extremely well-suited to any lawyer who represents a client
				involved in such a case.&nbsp; Richard also pours a great deal of time into
				preparing for his mediations.&nbsp; He has an excellent command of the facts
				of the case, regardless of its particular complexities, and the relationship
				between co-defendants, to the extent there are multiple defendants in a
				case.&nbsp; The tone he sets in his opening comments create an atmosphere of
				resolution, and I sincerely believe that he is able to see cases through to
				resolution that might not otherwise be resolved.&nbsp; Richard's dedication
				to mediation, his high talent level, and his reasonable fees (including no
				charges for travel expenses) make him the perfect choice in any complex
				matter.</p>
			<p>I would be delighted to discuss my experiences with Richard should you have
				any particular questions.</p>
