			<p>Dear Richard,</p>
			<p>I have been meaning to write this for months.&nbsp; This follows the
				double-header mediation we had earlier this year in Philadelphia.&nbsp; I
				was very pleased that we were able to resolve both cases, each a significant
				case, each with very capable plaintiff's counsel.</p>
			<p>Although my office had worked with you years earlier, in these recent matters,
				you came recommended by plaintiff's counsel.&nbsp; It was expected (and we were
				not disappointed), that you had a thorough working knowledge of the facts within
				the mediation memos, particularly the clinical records, as well as the procedural
				and evidentiary issues.&nbsp; Your level of preparation is as good as anyone I
				have ever worked with as a mediator.&nbsp; Your experience in long term care also
				places the participants in the mediation on notice that their position, or their
				exposure, and/or their demands, will be evaluated in the context of that experience.</p>
			<p>I thought your approach with both sides of the table was effective, whether
				speaking to a grieving or angry family member, or having some frank discussion
				with the industry representative.</p>
			<p>Of course, the bottom line is always, did we get the case resolved, and was
				the mediation that got us to that point effective, and cost effective.&nbsp; I
				can certainly say 'yes' to those questions.</p>
			<p>Thank you for your able assistance.&nbsp; I look forward to working with you
				again.&nbsp; Please do not hesitate to use me as a reference.</p>
			<p>Take care,</p>

			<p>Please accept this correspondence as my recommendation for Richard Strauss'
				services as a mediator. &nbsp;I am a practicing attorney who serves as national
				counsel to an insurer of a nursing home chain.&nbsp; In that capacity, I have
				had occasion to utilize Mr. Strauss' services as a mediator in several matters.
				&nbsp; I have found Mr. Strauss to be extremely effective in assisting the
				parties in resolving their differences in these cases.&nbsp; He consistently
				demonstrates a working knowledge of the facts absed upon written submissions
				received from counsel. &nbsp;He provides insight and thoughtfulness when
				presenting opposing points of view.&nbsp; I believe that his background and
				experience working with nursing homes and insurance carriers equips him with
				an unique perspective that is invaluable to the mediation process.&nbsp; I
				would highly recommend Richard as a mediator to any attorney or party
				interested in resolving their case.&nbsp; In my opinion, he is among the
				best mediators I have ever had the pleasure of working with.</p>
