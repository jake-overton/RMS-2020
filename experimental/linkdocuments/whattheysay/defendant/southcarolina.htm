			<p>My first encounter with Richard Strauss as a mediator came as the result of him
				being recommended by the insurance company.&nbsp; The parties chose him for the
				most recent mediation at the request of Plaintiff's counsel.&nbsp; Therefore,
				Richard is unique in that he has the respect of both sides.</p>
			<p>My practice areas are mainly in the defense of long term care facilities and
				medical malpractice. &nbsp;I would not hesitate to use Richard again as a mediator.
				&nbsp; He really has the long term care cases down to a science. &nbsp;He has the
				innate ability to understand and appreciate the issues from both sides.&nbsp; It
				was clear in my recent mediation that he had taken the time to read the pre-mediation
				packets submitted to him by the parties and was keenly aware of the issues involved.
				&nbsp; As such, it was not necessary spending multiple rounds in the mediation
				just to educate him.</p>
			<p>Richard is able to objectively analyze the issues and identify risks to both
				parties.&nbsp; At the end of the day, we were able to settle our case at the
				mediation.&nbsp; I do not believe this would have been possible without Richard's
				skills.&nbsp; I look forward to working with him again in the future.</p>

			<p>I had the opportunity to use Richard Strauss as a mediator for a long-term care
				dispute in South Carolina in May, 2015, recommended by our claim representative,
				who was well-acquainted with Richard's experience in mediating these types of cases.</p>
			<p>I found Richard's level of preparation and understanding of the key issues of
				the case to be outstanding.&nbsp; His competency was aided in no small part due
				to his extensive background in the long-term care and claim handling field.</p>
			<p>Richard's unique approach to mediation was extremely helpful in our case.
				&nbsp; He proposed, and we accepted, to forego opening statements by either
				side in order to create a conciliatory environment which was key in resolving
				our case.&nbsp; Moreover, he had helpful and novel suggestions and tools to
				bridge a rather large gap between the starting positions of both sides in our
				case.&nbsp; Finally, and most importantly, he was able to successfully resolve
				the case at mediation.&nbsp; I would whole-heartedly recommend Richard for any
				future mediations in the fields of medical malpractice and long term care.</p>
