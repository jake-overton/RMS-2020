			<p>Recently I had the opportunity to mediate a case with Richard M. Strauss, Esq.,
				who acted as a mediator on one of my nursing home cases.&nbsp; I represent
				nursing homes in the New York metropolitan area and I've been doing so for five
				years.&nbsp;  I have authored one published article in the field and numerous
				newsletters on the subject over the last five years.</p>
			<p>Mr. Strauss was recommended to us by the plaintiff's counsel which, in that
				case, was a very sophisticated firm.&nbsp;At first I was reluctant to agree to
				their choice, but since the mediator was available, and we wanted to get the
				case settled before the end of the year, I agreed that we would go forward.
				&nbsp; Generally speaking, I am often frustrated with mediators who really do
				not understand the nursing home law of New York and was delighted to find out
				that Mr. Strauss had an extensive background in handling nursing home claims
				for a company that owned hundreds of nursing homes.&nbsp; I also learned he had
				handled maters involving nursing homes for an insurance company in Texas.
				&nbsp; Thus, although he was recommended by a plaintiff's firm, Mr. Strauss'
				background was actually more consistent with our side of the case.</p>
			<p>Once we began, I learned immediately that Mr. Strauss had very carefully read
				all of our positions papers and had taken extensive notes detailing the events.
				&nbsp; The particular case involved a number of falls at a nursing home and the
				issue was whether or not the falls ultimately caused the death of the resident.</p>
			<p>Mr. Strauss gave opening comments which were especially helpful in making the
				plaintiff understand that by engaging in mediation the plaintiff herself, who
				was the daughter of the decedent, could control the destiny of the case.
				&nbsp; He explained that going to a jury would put the case in the hands of
				six or twelve strangers.&nbsp;  He observed that there will then be appellate
				review which could substantially reduce any award that was not in line with
				other awards in the jurisdiction.</p>
			<p>We were quite far apart in the mediation but I immediately began to develop a
				trust with Mr. Strauss.&nbsp;  I felt that I could discuss my views of the case
				openly and the limitations on our authority.&nbsp;  Ultimately, we reached an
				impasse and Mr. Strauss was very effective in using "brackets" to bring the
				parties together.&nbsp;  He then very astutely determined a bottom line number
				which, based on the information I supplied as a result of my confidence in his
				mediation skills, and the same information supplied by the plaintiff, apparently,
				allowed him to recommend a number to settle the case which I was able to recommend
				and obtain from the carrier.</p>
			<p>I don't ordinarily write letters like this but I was very impressed with Mr.
				Strauss' skills as a mediator and in particular his understanding of nursing
				home matters.&nbsp; You will not be disappointed if you select him.</p>
