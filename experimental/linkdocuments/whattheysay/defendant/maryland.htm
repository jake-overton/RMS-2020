      <p>This firm works entirely in the area of civil litigation, both for defendants
        and Plaintiffs.&nbsp; My own practice is focused primarily on personal injury
        defense, including medical negligence cases and products liability matters.
        &nbsp; Many of these cases involve claims of nursing home negligence.
        &nbsp; I have been involved in several private mediations, all in nursing home
        negligence cases, in which Richard M.&nbsp;Strauss, Esquire, has acted as the
        mediator.&nbsp; In all but one of those mediations, Mr. Strauss was able to
        assist the parties in settling the case, often under difficult circumstances.
        &nbsp; In that regard, Mr. Strauss' practice of not having counsel or the parties
        make "opening statements" about their respective positions helps reduce the
        emotion and grandstanding that often make settlement more difficult, particularly
        in cases involving a family member of the nursing home/assisted living resident.
        &nbsp; Instead, Mr. Strauss, himself, gives an opening presentation in which
        he explains the process and helps to create the appropriate non-confrontational
        atmosphere for a private mediation.&nbsp; This is particularly effective with
        family members who have not been involved previously in litigation and are
        apprehensive about the mediation process. </p>
      <p>Mr. Strauss' background, both as a lawyer and in the administration of claims
        involving nursing homes and assisted living facilities, was invaluable in the
        mediations I have had with him, both because it allowed him to properly
        evaluate the submissions of the parties factually and legally, including standard of
        care issues, and because it gives him a high level of credibility with the participants.
        &nbsp; In every instance, he was well-prepared and had clearly spent a great deal
        of time making himself familiar with the facts and applicable law.&nbsp; He also
        has been straightforward with me and my clients about the strengths and weaknesses
        he sees with my client's position in a particular case.&nbsp; In short, I would recommend
        Richard Strauss as a mediator, without reservation, and I would be happy to discuss
        this with anyone contemplating using his services.</p>
