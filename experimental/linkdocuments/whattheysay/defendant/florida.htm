			<p>I appreciate your hard work and the expertise which you brought to the mediation.

			<p>I wanted to write this correspondence on behalf of Richard M. Strauss, Esq.
				&nbsp; Mr. Strauss has done, and continues to do, an excellent job serving as a
				Mediator in those cases that our law firm has been defense counsel on.</p>
			<p>  Mr. Strauss, among other things, brings a tremendous amount of experience in
				the long-term care and medical malpractice arenas.&nbsp; I find, of particular
				benefit, Mr. Strauss' preparation, in advance of the Mediation, to be a key
				ingredient to success at Mediation.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss is always well prepared
				and is able to identify the key issues and focus, promptly, upon those issues
				at the commencement of Mediation.</p>
			<p>  Mr. Strauss is an inquisitive Mediator who asks well defined and astute
				questions during the course of Mediation.&nbsp; He is not merely a "messenger".
				&nbsp; He is a proactive Mediator.&nbsp; His proactivity reflects itself, in
				addition to asking questions, to providing options and suggestions during the
				course of the Mediation. </p>
			<p>  I have also been impressed with Mr. Strauss' ability to mediate in different
				jurisdictions.&nbsp; I have mediated with Mr. Strauss in Florida and in Texas
				and he was highly effective in both venues with a firm understanding of the
				applicable laws and the sensitivities of the venues in question. </p>
			<p>  Lastly, and certainly not to be overlooked, at least in my opinion, in the
				context of a Mediation, is Mr. Strauss' demeanor and professionalism.&nbsp; He
				very capably sets the stage for collegiality and helps to create a conciliatory
				environment which often times proves to be helpful in resolving cases.</p>
			<p> In sum, I have found Mr. Strauss to be a highly effective Mediator in very
				significant cases involving both complex legal and factual issues. </p>

			<p> I write to commend and recommend Richard M. Strauss as a mediator.&nbsp; Mr.
				Strauss successfully mediated a problematic long-term care case for our Firm.
				&nbsp; It became obvious in the mediation process that Mr. Strauss brought unique
				skills to bear in light of his experience with long-term care cases as well as
				medical malpractice and other tort cases.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' knowledge in the
				field enabled the parties to sort through and reckon with the medical and documentary
				issues contained in the case. </p>
			<p>I particularly recommend Mr. Strauss' approach to mediation in which he prepares
				extensively and takes on the role of advocate for both sides in the joint session.
				&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' strategy of removing some of the adversarial process and its
				potentially galvanizing effect worked very well in our experience. </p>
			<p>Mr. Strauss was also very helpful during the "witching" hour of the mediation
				by suggesting different approaches to the process.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss has no "quit"
				in him and his creative energy does not flag.</p>
			<p> If you want your case settled, I recommend Richard Strauss.</p>

			<p>While Mr. Strauss's services were recommended to me by the adjuster on the claim,
				Mr. Strauss proved to be an effective mediator for both the plaintiff and defense...
				The parties entered mediation with extremely different values on the case.&nbsp; Through
				a great deal of patience, perseverance and persuasiveness, Mr. Strauss was able to
				resolve the matter... In fact, the parties had undergone prior mediation of this
				claim and quickly reached impasse.&nbsp; I will continue, whenever possible, to
				use the services of Richard M. Strauss as a mediator and would highly recommend
				him to those attorneys and adjusters with whom I am associated.</p>

			<p>I wanted to send you a letter regarding the recent experiences I have had using
				Richard M. Strauss, Esq. as a mediator in some very high profile nursing home
				cases that I have defended... This is an unusual situation in that there are
				usually defense oriented mediators or plaintiff oriented mediators but very few
				that seem to be able to reach the equilibrium where both sides feel that they
				are getting the most from the mediator in representing their clients.&nbsp; I found
				that Richard is able to draw upon his wealth of experience and his varied background
				and ability to stay the course and keep the personalities and tempers in check and
				has brought the resolution of two very difficult cases.</p>
