			<p> I am writing this letter recommending the services of Richard Strauss as a
				mediator, especially in cases involving complex, multi-party litigation.
				&nbsp; Recently, Mr. Strauss served as the mediator in a matter involving six
				parties arising out of some fairly complex factual and legal disputes surrounding
				the care and treatment an elderly man received in the St. Louis, Missouri area.</p>
			<p>I found Mr. Strauss' qualifications and background to be of great assistance in
				resolving the matter.&nbsp; From the defense perspective, Mr. Strauss brings
				unique qualities based on his experience in the claims management process which
				defense clients find refreshing. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, Mr. Strauss was able to assimilate an incredible volume of
				information (there were over 60 depositions taken in the case prior to his
				involvement and thousands of pages of complicated medical information).
				&nbsp; Over a period of less than two days, he was able to digest this information
				and develop not only general factual strengths and weaknesses for both plaintiffs
				and the defendants, but also particularized strengths and weaknesses for each of
				the individual parties.&nbsp; In fact, Mr. Strauss was able to identify one key
				factual issue from the defense perspective that had not been fully developed
				despite over 14 months of discovery and in excess of 60 depositions. </p>
			<p>As you can imagine, this level of preparation creates a strong aura of
				credibility when discussing the risks and benefits of settlement with all
				parties.&nbsp; When Mr. Strauss offered specific options and suggestions, they
				were met with greater credibility in light of his nearly Herculean efforts in
				learning how different facts created different levels of exposure for each party. </p>
			<p>I recommend Mr. Strauss' services without hesitation or reservation.&nbsp; His
				flat fee approach is ideally suited for multi-party litigation.</p>
