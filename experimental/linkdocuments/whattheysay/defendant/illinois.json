        "We recently successfully mediated a medical malpractice case.&nbsp; I represented one defendant.&nbsp; Plaintiff's counsel as well as defense counsel agreed upon Richard Strauss as the mediator based on prior successful experience with him.&nbsp; Simply stated, Mr. Strauss comes recommended by both defense and plaintiff's counsel.&nbsp; His extensive experience in the area of medical malpractice and his thorough preparation and understanding of the key issues presented during mediation were major factors in resolving the case.",
        "Throughout mediation his observations, suggestions, and various options were instrumental in moving the case to a successful conclusion.",
        "Richard is an individual who we will definitely use in future medical malpractice mediations."

        "Since 1976 I have concentrated my practice in civil litigation, primarily as a defense attorney.&nbsp; For the last twenty years the majority of my practice has been the defense of medical malpractice cases.",
        "I recently had an opportunity to mediate a case with Richard Strauss of MediateOne.&nbsp; He was recommended to us by plaintiff's counsel.&nbsp; Ordinarily such a recommendation would give me pause for concern.&nbsp; However, after meeting Mr. Strauss and going through the mediation, any hesitation I had was quickly dispelled.",
        "I have never mediated a case with an individual that had a better understanding of the medical and legal issues that were presented in our case.&nbsp; It was apparent that Mr. Strauss had done his homework.&nbsp; He understood the medical issues, in some cases better than my opponent.",
        "Both parties trusted Mr. Strauss with their confidences and relied upon his judgment and analysis of the issues in the case.&nbsp; He offered many different options for us to consider in our attempts to settle the case and ultimately narrowed the parties' positions considerably after a long day's effort.",
        "Unfortunately, the case did not settle on the date mediated but Mr. Strauss continued the efforts afterwards over a period of several months ultimately successfully concluding the case.",
        "To say we were satisfied with his effort is an understatement.&nbsp; The fact that I have engaged him again to serve as a mediator in complicated malpractice cases and have recommended him to my colleagues reflects my confidence in his skills as a mediator.",
        "I welcome any questions that attorneys might have concerning Mr. Strauss' mediation services."

        "I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you again for your considerable efforts in helping us resolve the&hellip;litigation during our recent mediation in Huntington, West Virginia.",
        "As you know, a large part of my legal practice is comprised of defending nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in cases involving alleged medical negligence, violations of residents' rights, and related breach of contract and punitive damage claims.&nbsp; Over the past several years, I have participated in numerous mediations around the country with usually good results, but found your role in this matter especially impressive.",
        "Both my client and I were very pleased with your level of background knowledge in long-term care issues, as well as the level of preparation you brought to our particular case.&nbsp; As I believe I mentioned after the mediation, the fact that you did not have to be &quot;educated&quot; during the mediation about the allegations and the details of the resident's care made the negotiations move considerably smoother.&nbsp; Also, I think your ready knowledge of the facts and often rather minute details gave added weight and gravity to your recommendations to the respective parties.",
        "I also appreciated your good humor and ability to keep the parties negotiating in a positive manner, even during the more rancorous liability debates.&nbsp; Finally, I believe your deft handling of the rather unique personalities of some of the <i>attorneys'</i> involved is probably what finally got this case resolved, instead of ending in a costly stalemate.",
        "In any event, thank you again for your hard work during our recent mediation.&nbsp; I look forward to working with you again in the near future."

        "You did a terrific job and it was evident you worked very hard to get our case resolved.&nbsp; After our initial mediation back in 2013, I recommended you to several attorneys &ndash; both plaintiff and defendant.&nbsp; Your understanding of the issues and preparation in that case and the most recent case were impressive.&nbsp; The post-mediation work you did was just as impressive but also demonstrated the work you're willing to put in to see a resolution.&nbsp; That puts you in an elite class in my opinion.&nbsp; You'll be working with us again and your name will remain at the top of a short list of mediators who I'm pleased to refer to colleagues."
