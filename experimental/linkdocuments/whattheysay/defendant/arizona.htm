				<p>I am writing to recommend Richard Strauss to anyone who seeks a highly skilled,
				hard working, and thorough mediator dedicated to settling cases.&nbsp; I have
				had the opportunity to employ many mediators in various states in my litigation
				practice.&nbsp; As a result, I have had the opportunity to observe and learn a
				variety of methods and styles used by mediators.&nbsp; I have been particularly
				impressed by Richard Strauss, who has now successfully mediated a number of cases
				for several of my clients.&nbsp; Richard does more than most, if not all, mediators
				in preparation for a mediation.&nbsp; He comes to the mediation with a written
				chronology of the facts and pages of notes on the strengths and weaknesses of
				the case and often identifies strengths and weaknesses overlooked by the parties.
				&nbsp; Because he has invested so much time in the case before the mediation
				begins, and demonstrates his thorough knowledge of the facts and issues, my
				clients and I do not have to spend time getting him up to speed and the mediation
				process is better spent on bringing the parties together.&nbsp; My clients and
				I have developed a significant respect because he is well prepared and knowledgeable.
				&nbsp; In fact, I have become so accustomed to his methods and thorough knowledge
				of the legal and medical issues that I am visibly disappointed by more and more
				mediators, who do not prepare for and engage in the mediation process like Richard.
				&nbsp; In short, Richard sets the bar high for mediators. </p>
			<p>Many of the cases I litigate have medical issues since they involve medical care
				providers and nursing homes.&nbsp; Richard's prior work in this area has proven
				to be invaluable during the settlement process.&nbsp; He has "been there" and
				"done that" so he is more credible than most when he discusses likely outcomes
				if the case does not settle.&nbsp; His background also makes him uniquely valuable
				whether he is litigating in the northeastern or southwestern United States.</p>
			<p>Finally, he has the kind of conciliatory personality and people skills that assist
				plaintiffs who have not been through the process and helps them accept settlement
				and move on with their lives.&nbsp; The plaintiffs seem to feel good at the
				conclusion of the mediation, which means he has developed the necessary rapport
				to open the lines of communication and make settlement possible. </p>
			<p>Richard was recommended to me through a plaintiffs' lawyer who had worked with
				him in the past and I successfully mediated that case with Richard.&nbsp; I think
				plaintiffs and defendants find his style, methods, and energy he puts into
				mediation refreshing and the results outstanding.</p>
