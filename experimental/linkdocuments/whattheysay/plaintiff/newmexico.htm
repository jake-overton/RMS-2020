      <p>I am a plaintiff's attorney practicing in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and
        nationally.&nbsp; I have been doing nursing home cases for 17+ years with some
        success.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss has now served as a mediator for me in 2 cases, one
        in New Mexico and one in Nebraska.&nbsp; He is the singularly most prepared
        mediator I have ever met, taking time prior to the mediation to internalize
        both sides of the case in a way I have not seen done by others.&nbsp; This
        preparation makes him a very effective mediator.&nbsp; He is a pleasure,
        personally, and gets along well with clients.&nbsp; I would pass along my
        highest recommendation.&nbsp; Feel free to call or e-mail me with questions.</p>

      <p>With the help of Richard Strauss, we were able to get a substantial settlement
        in a recent medical malpractice action against a doctor and a hospital.&nbsp;
        Mr. Strauss was selected due to his extensive knowledge of medical malpractice
        cases from the defense point of view and knowledge of what these cases are really
        worth.&nbsp; We were very satisfied with the results that were achieved.&nbsp;
        There were additional reasons why we would use Mr. Strauss again.&nbsp; I found
        that since he has a defense-oriented background he understood our issues well,
        and more importantly, he understood the process it would take to gain a satisfactory
        settlement.&nbsp; He understood well that his role was to get the case settled,
        and that was the only way he could maintain his reputation as a successful mediator.
        &nbsp; Other matters that I thought were helpful were that he traveled from Georgia
        at his own expense, without charging any of the parties.&nbsp; Being tenacious,
        beginning in the morning hours and continuing until 8:00 p.m.&nbsp; When part of
        the case did not settle, he continued to push the case for settlement, which
        eventually caused the case to settle all at no additional charge.&nbsp; Coming to
        the mediation knowing the issues and having thoroughly reviewed the documents by
        each side before the mediation, expedited the process.&nbsp; His analysis was
        objective and impartial, identifying risks to both parties.&nbsp; Without hesitation,
        I will be strongly recommending that Mr. Strauss assist us in future mediations.</p>
