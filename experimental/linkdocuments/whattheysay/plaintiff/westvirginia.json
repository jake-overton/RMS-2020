        "I recently had the privilege of conducting a mediation with the services of Mr. Strauss.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' experience and knowledge in the area of nursing home litigation was a benefit to all involved.&nbsp; I was pleased with his ability to objectively analyze both sides of our case.&nbsp; It is clear that without Mr. Strauss' help and services as mediator we would not have been able to settle this case.",
        "This was my first mediation with Mr. Strauss who was suggested as a mediator by defense counsel.&nbsp; Even though this was my first experience with Mr. Strauss, I feel confident that should I need his services in the future, I will not hesitate to contact him.",
        "If you have any questions regarding Mr. Strauss' ability and effectiveness as a mediator, please do not hesitate to contact me."
