      "Richard Strauss recently mediated a nursing home neglect case for us which successfully resolved on the day of mediation.&nbsp; From the outset, it was apparent that Richard had thoroughly reviewed the materials we submitted in preparation for the mediation.&nbsp; His preparation, coupled with his thorough understanding of the issues, including the risks facing defendants which are unique to nursing home cases, allowed us to quickly put our focus upon the crux of the case.&nbsp; While he has an industry/defense background, he showed that he can clearly see the issues through a plaintiff lawyer's eyes.&nbsp; If you want an all out effort from a mediator who knows the issues like the back of his hand, I would highly recommend Richard.",
