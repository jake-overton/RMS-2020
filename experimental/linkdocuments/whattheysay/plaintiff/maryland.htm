      <p>We recently represented plaintiff's surviving family in a wrongful dealt suit against an Assisted Living Facility.&nbsp; Early in the litigation process, defendant's counsel suggested mediation with Richard Strauss, Esquire.&nbsp; Although we were initially skeptical about mediating with a mediator chosen by the defense, we decided to give it a try after reviewing many positive recommendations from plaintiff's attorneys.</p>
      <p>Mediation was recently held and did result in a settlement satisfactory to plaintiffs.&nbsp; I want to state that I found Mr. Strauss to be a true neutral party notwithstanding his defense background.&nbsp; He came to the mediation thoroughly prepared and had an excellent understanding of all the issues in the case.&nbsp; He made the plaintiffs feel comfortable throughout the mediation and I believe they did trust his judgment and his sincere interest in getting the case settled.</p>
      <p>I have been involved as an attorney representing the plaintiff in hundreds of mediations and have served as a court appointed mediator in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, Maryland.&nbsp; I am a graduate of the Harvard Law School Program on Mediation.</p>
      <p>Based on my background and experience in the recent case with Mr. Strauss, I can state that he is an excellent mediator and that I would not hesitate to refer a case to him in the future.</p>
