      <p>Richard Strauss recently mediated a nursing home neglect case for us which successfully
        resolved on the day of mediation.&nbsp; From the outset, it was apparent that Richard had
        thoroughly reviewed the materials we submitted in preparation for the mediation.&nbsp; His
        preparation, coupled with his thorough understanding of the issues, including the risks facing
        defendants which are unique to nursing home cases, allowed us to quickly put our focus upon the
        crux of the case.&nbsp; While he has an industry/defense background, he showed that he can
        clearly see the issues through a plaintiff lawyer's eyes.&nbsp; If you want an all out effort
        from a mediator who knows the issues like the back of his hand, I would highly recommend
        Richard.</p>
