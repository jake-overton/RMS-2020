      <p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in a successful mediation
        wherein Richard Strauss was the mediator.&nbsp; I thought he did a fine
        job.</p>
      <p>Mr. Strauss was recommended to me by the defense counsel in the
        case.&nbsp; I always find in a mediation that I want a mediator that the
        defendant will listen to.&nbsp; Therefore, I was receptive to the defense
        counsel's suggestion.</p>
      <p>He mentioned that he had over 2200 mediations under his belt.&nbsp; He was
        thoroughly prepared.&nbsp; His level of understanding in this medical
        malpractice case was thorough.&nbsp; He was not afraid to give positive
        and negative points to both sides regarding the case.&nbsp; His approach
        led to a thorough discussion of the issues in the case without polarizing
        the parties.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, I would recommend Mr. Strauss to a Plaintiff's lawyer with a
        medical malpractice case.&nbsp; I am sure I will use him again in the
        future.</p>

      <p>I am writing to commend you on the manner in which you recently mediated
        our plaintiff's case in Belleville, IL.</p>
      <p>I can tell you, without reservation, that all of the attorneys who were
        involved in this case were extremely pleased with the way you conducted
        the mediation, your effectiveness in garnering compromise from both sides,
        and, of course, a result that was acceptable to all parties concerned.</p>
      <p>I should let you know that a friend from law school who has done defense
        work in Kansas City, Missouri, for over 40 years recently called to ask
        for the names of mediators that I would recommend.&nbsp; I gave him your
        name and later called him to tell him about you.</p>
      <p>If a plaintiff's attorney is in need of a reference regarding your
        services, please do not hesitate to have them contact me.</p>
      <p>We look forward to mediating with you in the future.&nbsp; Your
        objectivity and impartiality are strong characteristics which we
        appreciate finding in a mediator.</p>
