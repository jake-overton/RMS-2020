      <p>I recently had the pleasure of working with Richard wherein we successfully
        mediated the majority of a very difficult and complicated case.&nbsp;
        We were able to resolve many of the contested issues and greatly simplify
        the litigation as a whole...</p>
      <p>Richard's knowledge of the subject matter was to say the least, surprising
        and refreshing.&nbsp; Richard is now one of the two mediators I will agree to
        work with in the future.&nbsp; He was thorough, professional, diligent, at times
        dogmatic and most importantly neutral.</p>
      <p>From the inception of the mediation Richard was able to create an atmosphere
        which I felt promoted openness in discussion which obviously steered the matter
        toward resolution.&nbsp; I specifically would like to reiterate the level of
        preparation exhibited.&nbsp; Not only was he intimately familiar with all of the
        facts presented on both sides, but also the implicit arguments that would be made
        based on those facts.&nbsp; He further very astutely was able to help all involved
        to recognize and/or acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses in each.</p>
      <p>If I can be of any further assistance, or if any person to whom this concerns
        would like to speak with me, please feel free to contact me...</p>
