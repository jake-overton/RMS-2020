      <p>If written notification is received that a case is cancelled or rescheduled <b><u>after the confirmation letter outlining date, location and starting time for the mediation and invoice have been sent out to the parties,</u></b> a cancellation fee of <b><u>$250.00</u></b> will be charged to the responsible party(s).</p>

      <p>This policy is necessary because as your mediator, a commitment is made to block out the necessary date and time for each hearing.&nbsp; Out of pocket expenses are incurred as well.&nbsp; If a case is cancelled or rescheduled on such short notice, the mediator's time is lost.</p>
